## Design

### Design Choices

This website was designed so that the user has a sense and feeling of being in the countryside. Using colours found in nature that represents the trees, the ground and the landscape the user should feel at ease being on this site. 



### Colour

Again, the colours used on this website is to reflect the colours you shoudl find in the great outdoors. Using green, brown, white and off white colours complement nicely. I used Adobe Colour to find the mix of colours to use and wrote some quick code on the index.html page to put these colours to the test. 

![Colour scheme](docs/Colour-pallet.png)


### Fonts 

Fonts imported form Google fonts and includes Poppins and Roboto with a sans-serif as a fallback. Clean and easy to read fonts were important for the user on this website so the information is clear and easy to read.


### Structure

The layout and structure of the website is set in a familiar and user friendly way. Navigation links set to the right of the page and the title on the left as the majority of people read left to right. The website consists of 5 separate pages. 
- A home page with sections for brief info and next big group walk
- An about us page with information on what the webite is and a small gallery of images below 
- A walks page, which details some walking routes reccommended by the website
- A group walks page that shows the major group walks that are organised 
- A sign up page where the user can sign up to a newsletter and become a member

## Validation 


### HTML Validation 

The W3C Markup Validation service was used to validate all 5 pages of HTML code. All pages passed with no errors, but some warnings on about us page due to no headings on a particular section. This is a design choice. 

<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="docs/validations/html/home-validation-html.png">

<details><summary>About Us</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>Sign Up</summary>
<img src="docs/validations/html/sign-up-validation-html.png">
</details>


### CSS Validation

The W3C CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS code by URL and direct input. All CSS code showed to pass all code by URL and direct input.

</details>
<details><summary>Direct Input (style.css)</summary>
<img src="docs/validations/css/css-validation-direct-input.png">
</details>

## Bugs 

- Group walks page has a larger gap between the next group walks section and the footer. Attempted to fix, but no success yet. Working on fix. 
- About Us image gallery has an odd number of images so when the media queriess kick and reduce column count to 2 it presents a stand alone image at the bottom of the page. Looking at reducing number of images or adding an addtional one, though this may present issues for viewing at larger screen sizes.
- Relating to the first issue, Firefox displays the web pages with not enough gap between the footer and the section that lives above it. Working on fix.
- 404 seems to need a cache clear to work properly. Struggling to keep consistent. 
- Using inspect mode on my computer to view screen responsiveness seems to work fine, but have seen some elements not display correctly on others machine when using this mode. Tested on smaller mobile screens and seems fine, but inspect shows something different for other people. Can't find fix for it, but looks correct from my inspect mode and screen.
