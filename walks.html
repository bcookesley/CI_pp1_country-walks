          <h3>Seafront Walk: Brighton</h3>
          <p>This is a great walk for everyone to do. It's not too long and plenty of places to stop along the way. What
            most people love about this walk is that when you get to the end point there are still lots of modes of
            transport to get you back home.
            There's loads of things to see and do along this route and as it's next to the seafront, there are plenty of
            great views to take in. West Pier is one of the sights everyone loves and wants to see and is a great place
            to
            stop and rest, or take some pictures of the infamous pier.

          <h3>Brighton Marina to Rottingdean</h3>
          <p>This is a short walk that takes roughly 60-90 minutes to do. The great thing about this walk is that you
            can either walk alongside the roadside and give yourself the vast views of the sea and Brighton, or you can
            walk on promanade below. Walking on the path below is just as beautiful and there is also a place where you
            can sit down and get some food or a drink if you fancy.
            If you're feeling brave enough you can awlays do one route there and the other on the way back, but you can
            just hop on a bus easily enough and be back Brighton side in 5 minutes or so. However, there are some places
            to pop along for a drink or for some food in Rottingdean, so you can awlways treat yourself to some food, or
            well deserved drink and taxi ride back to Brighton.

          <h3>South Downs Walk</h3>
          <p>The South Downs Walk is one we get told about a lot as there are so many start and end points to this
            route. We reccommend starting a Firle and following the trail round there, as that sits roughly in the 3-3
            1/2 hour mark to do fully.
            However, if you want to reseach the Downs and make your own route that is perfectly doable and we would be
            really interested to see what routes others take. Some of the routes can have steep inclines, which will
            make the route much harder so just be considerate of that when researching.

          <h3>Falmer to Lewes</h3>
          <p>Starting at the Amex satdium or the University of Sussex you make your way over to Lewes in a diagonal
            fashion. This route can be seen on the map and it roughly takes 4-5 hours dependng on your walking speed.
            However, on a nice this walk offers some fantastic places to stop and have some lunch and restbite before
            conitinuing on with your journey. Once you get to Lewes there are lots of places to go and drink, eat, relax
            or just catch the train home. This lovely little town has a lot to offer though, so we do advise you go and
            see some of what it has to offer.
